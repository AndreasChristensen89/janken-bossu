        <h2>Setting of the game</h2>
        <p>In Japan, Rock Paper Scissors, or <em>Janken</em> as it is known, is a very common game used almost daily to
            make various decisions. It is used by kids and adults alike in the kindergarten, in the school yard, and
            even in the work place. Japanese culture teaches people that "The nails that stick up get hammered down",
            which is another way of saying that people should not be too different, nor insistent on having things their
            own way. As a result, this can make it akward and stressful to suggest something as simple as where to eat, who
            picks up the check at restaurants, and who gets the last slice of cake. At a young age, Japanese kids are
            taught to resolve sibling quarrels with a game of Janken. The main idea is that it's a game that comes as
            close as possible to pure chance, and that it alleviates the pressure of decision making and leaves no
            guilty part to blame.</p>
            <!-- <img src="assets/images/settling.webp" alt="Two cartoons characters finishing a game a Janken, one of them is flustered as he just lost"> -->
        <p>In the setting of this game the expanded Janken has become so integrated in modern Japanese life that promotions at work
            are settled by this very game. You start at the very bottom of a large cooperation and will have to Janken your way to
            the top of the hierarchy. Each opponent will get increasingly strong, meaning that a loss will result in
            increasingly more hit-damage. Defeat all opponents without plummeting to 0 health and you will take over as the bigg boss.</p>
