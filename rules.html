        <h2>Setting of the game</h2>
        <p>In Japan, Rock Paper Scissors, or <em>Janken</em>(じゃん拳) as it is known, is a game frequently used to
            settle all kinds of disputes. In the western world the game is often used light-heartedly, however Japan
            takes it to another level. At a young
            age, Japanese kids are taught to resolve sibling quarrels with a game of
            Janken. Who gets the last snack? Who gets to play with that toy? You see it daily in kindergartens and in
            school yards. The main idea is that it's a game that
            comes as close as possible to pure chance, it alleviates the pressure of decision making, and leaves no
            guilty part to blame.</p>
        <p>In the setting of this game the expanded Janken has become so integrated in modern Japanese life that
            promotions at work
            are settled by this very game. Gone are the days of simple three-choice Janken, it is now upgraded to the
            infamous five-choice Janken. You start at the very bottom of a large cooperation and will have to Janken
            your way to
            the top of the hierarchy. Opponents will get increasingly strong, meaning that a loss will result in
            more and more hit-damage. Defeat all opponents without plummeting to 0 health and you will take over as
            the bigg boss.</p>
